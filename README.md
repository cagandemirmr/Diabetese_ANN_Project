## Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model using the diabetes dataset and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture. The ANN architecture was implemented using the TensorFlow library. The model was trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32. After training, the model was converted into a function that makes predictions based on user input data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes dataset, which contains information about various health metrics of individuals and whether they have diabetes or not. The dataset can be used for binary classification tasks to predict the presence of diabetes based on various health features.
About Dataset
The Diabetes prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. This dataset can be used to build machine learning models to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information. This can be useful for healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans. Additionally, the dataset can be used by researchers to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes.
